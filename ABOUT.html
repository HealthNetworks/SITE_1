    <h3 class="text-accent">Dr Jonathan M Clarke  <span class = 'header-text-small'>MA(Cantab.) MB BChir MRCS MPH FRSA</span></h3>

    <p>Jonathan is a clinician and academic in the Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare at Imperial College London and recently completed his doctoral studies in the Institute of Global Health Innovation. He holds a Masters in Public Health from Harvard University where he was a Kennedy Scholar. His research explores the interface between health and society in modern, data-driven health systems. Jonathan is fascinated by the delivery of healthcare in its broader societal context. He focuses on how the vast array of available health and social information may be harnessed to address health inequality in the United Kingdom and internationally.<br>

      <br>Jonathan grew up in Hartlepool in the North East of England, after which he graduated from the University of Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Clinical Medicine as a Windsor Bachelor Scholar at Emmanuel College. He began his clinical career as an Academic Foundation Programme doctor in London, before being appointed as an Academic Clinical Fellow in General Surgery at Imperial College London. He has worked internationally with the United Nations, World Health Organization, Medecins du Monde, the Francois Xavier Bagnoud Centre for Health and Human Rights, the Institute for the Future of Work and the Health Foundation to explore the complex relationships between health systems and society.<br>
       
      <br>Jonathan is an experienced public speaker who has lectured internationally on topics as diverse as the efficiency of junior doctors and the human rights to healthcare for migrants. Presently he applies network analysis and machine learning to understand the equity and efficiency of modern health systems across the world.</p>

      <h3 class="text-accent">Dr Leigh R Warren  <span class = 'header-text-small'>MBBS</span></h3>
      
      <p>Leigh is currently working as a Clinical Research Fellow in the Institute of Global Health Innovation and Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London. He completed his medical training at the University of Adelaide in 2011 and is a General Surgery Registrar with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. He maintains a clinical interest working in surgery at St Mary's Hospital, London.<br>
        <br>Leigh has a broad academic base in public health, health policy, digital health and surgical research. He enjoys teaching and was previously an Associate Clinical Lecturer at the University of Adelaide, prior to moving to the UK to commence his PhD studies at Imperial College. He teaches at Imperial College on the Masters in Patient Safety course.<br>
        <br>Leigh's current research work is focussed on the interface between people, data and technology. His research has a particular focus on patient safety and how transitions of care can be measured and improved using big data and digital technology. Much of Leigh's work has focussed on electronic health record interoperability as a means to better share meaningful patient information between providers. His work as a clinician both in the UK and Australia highlighted how patients are often exposed to risk and inefficient care when their medical information is not adequately communicated between hospitals. His work has been shared widely through several peer-reviewed journals.</p>
